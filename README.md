# Snake-Game-Js
This snake game is made using the HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around a grid or game board.
The objective is to eat food items that appear on the grid while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake’s
own body.
 HTML: For creating the game board and rendering the elements.CSS For styling the game elements and providing
visual effects
 JavaScript: For implementing game logic, controlling the snake’s movements, handling collisions, and updating the
score.
 Players earn points for each food item eaten.The score increases as the snake consumes more food items.
 The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the game board.The game also ends if the snake
collides with its own body, which makes maneuvering skillful and challenging.
The snake game can be played using the arrow keys.
